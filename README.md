### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm John! Just your average DIY coder. I'm a fan of learning new of things. So far, I'm currently proficient in C#, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, although my favorite projects usually happen in C#. I started out gaming, then creating mods for that game, and now I'm learning how to make my own games on unity. I'm not only a fan of creating games, I enjoy making applications in general, that's why I'm mostly looking into the development side of coding. If you got something for me to make, you've gotten the right man.
